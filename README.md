# Python-TripleDES
Encrypt and Decrypt Data in Python using Cryptography Library - TripleDES
Johnny needs your help (again). Write a Phttps://github.com/Jaswinder/Python-TripleDESython program that uses the cryptography.io API to encrypt plaintext 
‘Crypto is fun and entertaining’ using 3DES in OFB mode with the following combination of keys and nonce:

k = b12345678 
nonce = b12345678 
cl = ? 
#this is the ciphertext 
k = b12345678abcdefghabcdefgh 
nonce = b12345678 
c2 = ? #


k = b'abcdefghabcdefgh12345678'

nonce = b'12345678'

c3 = ? #this is the ciphertext


Is there anything to explain to Johnny about ciphertexts c1, c2, and c3? Submit your Python code (py). 
Your response should be submitted as comments within your code, as well as the values you obtained for c1, c2, and c3 in byte format 
(e.g., b'\x98x\xc3\xc3\xb7.>H\x1b\xdeY/X\xee~\xbbH\x1b\xdeY/X\xee~\xbb
